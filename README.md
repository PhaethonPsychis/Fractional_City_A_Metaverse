## CRYPTO-WEB3 URBANISM RESEARCH
### THE CYBER URBAN REGIONAL METROPOLIS: COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP OF CITIES AND DECENTRALIZED PROGRAMMABLE GOVERNANCE
Blockchain, web3, and internet, have unlocked the field of private urban developments for innovation and disruption. This group of technologies, unlocks our potential to design new models of cities and develop the new regional metropolis that can harness the transformational power of urbanization and become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

Innovation in urbanism start with the introduction of a native crypto-web3 virtual city that embeds city systems such as legal, regulatory framework, and urban governance, into web3 application-protocols. This innovation, still very early in its evolution, will enable collective ownership and decentralized programmable governance of our urban environment. The cyber world serves as the basis for the development of new forms of urbanism arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment.<br><br>
Crypto-web3 urbanism it‚Äôs a space that we‚Äôve only just begun to explore. There are already great challenges that are fundamental to how this socio-technical urbanism movement will evolve. These challenges include hard questions about our vision for the city  and the cyber urban living. To address these challenges we need to develop new mental models of the cyber-urban city. There are also fundamental challenges on how the protocols should be structured to help citizens coordinate and how to identify ways to integrate a complex system of blockchain networks into the design and production of our architectural and urban [governance] space.<br><br>
Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The crypto-web3 urbanism is the evolution to the cyber urban regional metropolis. This is the vision we are working to build and contains the following conceptual models:<br><br>
#### Collective urban development 
A cyber urban system specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.
#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in a city, is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. The range of the term "assets" include public utility cooperatives, public goods, the public space and natural resources, and city's revenues. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.
#### The vision for cyber urban worlds: Programmable governance
The cyber-urban city is a complex system of native crypto-web3 protocols . In its final form this is a-metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environments. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.  

## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB
There is an opportunity for an urban development research lab to invent the vision of the cyber urban regional metropolis and help integrate urbanism with crypto-web3 technologies by bringing together talent from many different disciplines and communities with shared interests.<br>
The second stage of the lab is to take these scientific breakthroughs into production and enable communities to build new cities, and create territorial and societal transformations.<br><br>
#### WEBUILD X 0XDDRL
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Most projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the "vision of the client".<br><br>
The WEBUILD X 0XDDRL model is simple and powerful solution: A decentralized network of people, that shape a vision, pool funds together and partner with a nation<br> WEBUILD offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.

## TOKEN ECONOMY FOR DECENTRALISED COORDINATION
The lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of a self-organising ecosystem for education, research and development<br><br>
#### Why a token?
A crypto economy enable participants to engage and raise their voice in a documented manner. The token is a membership subscription that is also used as a vote. 
#### Incentives system
The token allows us to create an incentives system. We want to provide the community with the means to coordinate work and allow participants to collaborate with each other to make decisions about a project. We want to enable the organic formation of self-organized permissionless working groups where everyone can participate and contribute.
We will also use tokens to create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>

Tokens are the primary source of funding for the lab. We have setup a smart contract vending machine to sell the tokens at a fixed price. 

#### $DDRL Fractions of an iconic research lab
Fractions unlock the value of the network. The $DDRL token gives people the power to vote on projects they like and surface the signal on the direction and implementation of the research. The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power.

#### $DDRL tokens are redeemable. 
Tokens can be used to interact with future services such as the acquisition of a virtual land plot  at a desirable address or  a participation certificate.

### My Notes
Metaverse is not VR
# üõ∏ A Metaverse for collective ownership of cities, and decentralized, programmable governance!

Everyone can own a fraction of the city, and help shape its future.üéñ Fractional ownership unlocks the potential of the world‚Äôs most sought after assets: Cities!<br><br>
üèÑüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö¥üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è DDRL Metaverse is specifically constructed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a new city from scratch.<br>

## The Cyber-Urban City.
DDRLM offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. <br><br>This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>
 
#### The Cyber Urban Metaverse‚Äîincreases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities
By introducing a Metaverse we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps in starting very large scale urbanization developments.<br> The Metaverse has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.<br><br> 
#### Use the Metaverse to create an economic and social reform blueprint <br>
Autonomous Cities with the use of Cyber-Urban Environments are a critical response to the failures of centrally-planned government policies.

### üöÄ $DDRL incentives and governance Token: Building an ecosystem with the community
$DDRL is an Ethereum token that gives holders governance rights in the Decentralised Research and Design Lab.<br><br> The DDRL Token governs the development of the "DDRL Metaverse" project, giving holders the right to vote on the direction and implementation of the project.<br><br> The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power. <br><br>


üí∞ $DDRL tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
$DDRL tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

üèó $DDRL tokens are redeemable. You may exchange them to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name or use them to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>

This is a living document and we will update it as the community grows and the project evolves.<br>
