## A Metaverse for collective ownership of cities
Everyone can own a fraction of the city, and help shape its future<br>
We are creating a metaverse to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making<br><br>

## 🛠 What is the DDRL Decentralized Design Research Lab?
DDRL is a self-organised ecosystem of communities and teams that support the design and development of Autonomous Cyber Urban environments.<br><br> Our goal is to solve the problems associated with Private Cities: investors funding, participation and governance.
#### Creating a Metaverse
By introducing a Metaverse we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps in developing a new city from scratch.<br><br> The Metaverse has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.<br><br> 

## Why Autonomous Cities? 
AMECX is a critical response to the failures of centrally-planned government policies. 

## 👫 Incentivized Joint development  👫👫👫👫

The Autonomous Metaverse City offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own.<br>
### Roadmap to the development of an Autonomous City


### 🌐 Design a unique transformative economic and social reform blueprint that brings a region up to the world.
International multi disciplinary event.
 
### 🏙 Metaverse Lands  📬 Name and addresses registry
A Virtual Land, address, and avatar name registry system is under development. Their purpose is to serve as a community-building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and services while helping people build capacity with web3 technologies and governance processes.


## 🚀 $DDRL incentives and governance Token: Building an ecosystem with the community
$DDRL is an Ethereum token that gives holders governance rights in the Decentralised Research and Design Lab.<br><br> The DDRL Token governs the development of the "Autonomous Cities in the Metaverse" project, giving holders the right to vote on the direction and implementation of the project.<br><br> The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power. <br><br>


💰 $DDRL tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
$DDRL tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 $DDRL tokens are redeemable. You may exchange them to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name or use them to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>





# ❓ FAQ
### ⚡️ The Metaverse is the interface to create new cities!
This is a metaverse specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.<br>
Fractional ownership in a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>

### 💎 A new era for cyber-urban life. The Metaverse is the interface to experience our urban environments!
In its final form this metaverse becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environments, populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space.<br><br>
The new cyber-urban environment is a Metaverse where contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>


###  What kind of technology is the metaverse?
The Cyber Urban Metaverse—a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain cooperatives, digital assets, virtual land systems, decentralized governance, and social platforms— increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities.<br><br>

This is a living document and we will update it as the community grows and the project evolves.<br>
