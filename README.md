## URBANISM 3.0 — RESEARCH. 
### CYBER-URBAN COMMONS 3.0: THE AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL METROPOLIS
##### The purpose of Urbanism 3.0 is to create new forms of urbanism enabled by open source decentralised  applications and protocols that run as immutable code on a platform that provides strong guaranties about the future execution of the code.<br><br>
Ethereum, a blockchain computer that is fully programmable, has a unique property: It enables societies to write permanent code that has clear rules about how it will work in the future. That property has enabled the emergence of an independent field of knowledge and a space for innovation—The crypto-web3 domain.<br>
The integration of the crypto-web3 domain into the field of architecture and urbanism unlocks a completely new and innovative domain of projects and research, pushing the boundaries of these disciplines in new directions. 

The new crypto-urbanism domain make it possible to build novel models for cities around complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses based on collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of crypto-open internet—urbanism-[and architecture] become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.<br><br> 
We are only just beginning to explore the potential of crypto[graphy], open-internet and urbanism. There are already many challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this socio-technical urbanism movement successful. These challenges include developing a collective vision for the city of the future, translating political and social philosophy into an ecosystem of internet protocols, among other issues<br><br>

There is an opportunity for a community-collective to champion the production of the first collectively-owned Autonomous City, and create a new era for cities. Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The new crypto-urbanism [protocol and decentralized application platform] uses public-community partnerships to unlock the potential of communities to fund and finance new cities from scratch. <br><br>

note: the term "crypto" is a shortcut to "cryptographic blockchain technology" where "blockchain" is 
  
## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN and DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH LAB
### URBANISM 3.0 WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE OF CITIES AND FORM THE METROPOLIS OF THE FUTURE
We are introducing a research lab to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of Ethereum with the field of Urban Design and to help shape the domain of Urbanism 3.0 as an area of study and a framework to explore, invent and construct our collective future.<br><br>
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this project in which self-organised teams of international researchers come to the lab to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities. <br><br>
This is a new type of lab that is organized as a collective on blockchain and functions as a platform allowing communities to pool their resources and collectively fund research for the cities of the future.
The lab operates as an open-source research hub with permissionless access for open public discussion and joint development enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field.Its native token economy creates a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>

The lab is a work in progress that challenges the norms of how we conceive, build and live within our environment. The crypto-ubanism framework of research is comprised of three pillars
#### THE CITIES OF THE FUTURE
* Vision  
* Models and Protocols  
* Governance, Collectives, and Risk Management

#### WEBUILD: COLLECTIVE DEVELOPMENT
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the "vision of the client" with citizens aas the consumers of the "product"<br><br>
The WEBUILD flip this model on its head. WEBUILD enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. WEBUILD offers a powerful solution for societies to advance new private cities,  and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.

#### PROTOCOLS and DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION PLATFORM for URBANISM 3.0
## DECENTRALISED APPLICATIONS

### THE AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL METROPOLIS: CYBER-URBAN COMMONS 3.0  
The vision for cyber urban worlds: <br>
Urbanism 3.0 introduces the concept of cyber urban commons 3.0. A class of protocols to connect a public good to a community-owned and operating network that collectively decide on the allocation of resources. The protocol is immutable blocks of code -insert- <br>
Cyber urban commons 3.0 are decentralized applications to enable the  deployment of institutional structure of cooperative organizations on the blockchain around public goods.<br>
The city use the novel commons 3.0 mechanism to assign the creation, governance maintenance, and renewal of commonly shared resources to protocols that run on the open internet for the citizens to access and participate.<br>

The cyber urban commons 3.0 are public goods [resources] that benefit humanity and generate revenue for the city which is distributed to the shareholders, "the citizens".  They are new classes of assets. The urban commons 3.0 solves the problem of governing resources used by many individuals in common where collective action can either preserve the commons or deplete it.


#### This is the Urbanism 3.0 version of a public goods cooperative:<br> 
think of a community of people that vote for the production of electricity from fusion and contribute to the joint development of the cooperative, rather than -insert-sold to individuals. Version of this model is the Bitcoin network and Ethereum 2.0  <br>


#### City 3.0 is network an autonomous cooperatives 
All types of Common resources, natural jabitats, public services, private, or nonprofit organizations are organized as crypto cooperatives on the "blockchains network" and are collectively governed by the community. The AC is a decentralized network of cooperatives that manage different commons. The AC is a public good that is jointly owned and managed by all the cooperatives.
The urban commons are assets that benefit humanity [public goods] and generate revenue for the city which is distributed to the shareholders, "the citizens." <br>



#### Urban Governance is dynamic and programmable. Cyber-to-urban interactions
Urbanism 3.0 offers a variety of models for community governance 
offering a variety of models, such as the appointment of delegators where redistribution of votes is dynamic and not associated with an "election" event to happen.<br><br>
Urban resources management. The management of assets in an autonomous city is done by a decentralized network of cooperatives. The cooperatives are responsible for managing all forms of risk. In a blockchain environment, this is happening real-time and is open source.

#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in public goods or a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes [insert]in the physical and cyberspace. It is a new way of managing and developing the city's assets that includes public goods, utilities, and natural resources. This type of ownership allows for collective governance and management of these assets for the benefit of the city as a whole.
####  cyber-to-urban interactions. connected cyber-urban environments. Programmable Avatars and governance
In its final form the cyber-urban city exposes a metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environment. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.
