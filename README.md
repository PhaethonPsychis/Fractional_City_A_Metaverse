# 🛸 A Metaverse for collective ownership of cities, and decentralized, programmable governance!
Everyone can own a fraction of the city, and help shape its future.🎖 Fractional ownership unlocks the potential of the world’s most sought after assets: Cities!<br><br>
🏄🏽‍♂️⛹️‍♂️🚴🏿‍♀️ DDRL Metaverse is specifically constructed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a new city from scratch.<br>

## 🍕 $DDRL Fractions of an iconic metaverse

## 🛠 What is the DDRL Decentralized Design Research Lab?
DDRL is a crypto-cooperative, a self-organised ecosystem of communities and teams that are focused on building this metaverse. The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and  governance.<br> 
 
#### The Cyber Urban Metaverse—increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities
By introducing a Metaverse we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps in starting very large scale urbanization developments.<br> The Metaverse has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.<br><br> 
#### Use the Metaverse to create an economic and social reform blueprint <br>
Autonomous Cities with the use of Cyber-Urban Environments are a critical response to the failures of centrally-planned government policies.

## What kind of Cities can we build? 
DDRLM offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. <br><br>This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>

## DDRL generates innovation  and push the boundaries on:
>What is a metaverse and how to use it to eliminate poverty<br><br>
>new models for the design and development on cities and infra systems <br><br>
>Socio-Economic development models<br><br>
>Research and development Ecosystems<br><br>
>Expand the discourse of Architecure<br><br>

### 🚀 $DDRL incentives and governance Token: Building an ecosystem with the community
$DDRL is an Ethereum token that gives holders governance rights in the Decentralised Research and Design Lab.<br><br> The DDRL Token governs the development of the "DDRL Metaverse" project, giving holders the right to vote on the direction and implementation of the project.<br><br> The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power. <br><br>


💰 $DDRL tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
$DDRL tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 $DDRL tokens are redeemable. You may exchange them to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name or use them to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>

## ❓ FAQ
### ⚡️ The Metaverse is the interface to create new cities!
This is a metaverse specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.<br>
Fractional ownership in a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>

### 💎 A new era for cyber-urban life. The Metaverse is the interface to experience our urban environments!
In its final form this metaverse becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environments, populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space.<br><br>
The new cyber-urban environment is a Metaverse where contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>


###  What kind of technology is the metaverse?
The Cyber Urban Metaverse—a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain cooperatives, digital assets, virtual land systems, decentralized governance, and social platforms— increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities.<br><br>
