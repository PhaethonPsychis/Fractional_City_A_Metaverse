## CRYPTO-WEB3 URBANISM RESEARCH
### THE CYBER URBAN REGIONAL METROPOLIS: COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP AND DECENTRALIZED PROGRAMMABLE GOVERNANCE
Ethereum, a blockchain computer that is fully programmable, has a unique property: It enables societies to write permanent code that has clear rules about how it will work in the future. That property has enabled the emergence of an independent field of knowledge and a space for innovation‚ÄîThe crypto-web3 domain.
The integration of the crypto-web3 domain into the field of architecture and urbanism unlocks a completely new and innovative domain of projects and research, pushing the boundaries of these disciplines in new directions.

The new crypto-urbanism domain make it possible to build novel models for cities around complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses centered around collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and build private cities in regional scale that become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of crypto‚Äî[architecture and]‚Äîurbanism become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy. 

Crypto-web3 urbanism it‚Äôs a space that we‚Äôve only just begun to explore. There are already great challenges that are fundamental to how this socio-technical urbanism movement will evolve. These challenges include hard questions about our vision for the city of the future, and the way we live in cyber urban worlds. There is a need to develop new mental models for the future. There are also fundamental challenges on how to translate a political and social philosophy that drives urban design into a system of contracts or how the protocols should be structured to help citizens coordinate and how to identify ways to integrate a complex system of blockchain networks into the design and production of our architectural and urban [governance] space.<br><br>
Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The new crypto-web3 urbanism field unlocks the potential of societies to accelerate innovation. <br><br>
The vision we are working to build and contains the following concepts and primitives:
#### Collective urban development 
A cyber urban system specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.
#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in a city, is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. The range of the term "assets" include public utility cooperatives, public goods, the public space and natural resources, and city's revenues. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.
#### A metaverse for cyber urban programmable governance
In its final form the cyber-urban city exposes a metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environment. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.  

## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB
There is an opportunity for a research lab to help with the design and development of crypto cities.
* The first objective of the lab is to develop novel city models around crypto protocols and to help integrate blockchain technologies into the production of the urban environment.
* The second objective of the lab is to bring together the domain of crypto with the domain of urbanism and create a new scientific unified field.
* The third objective is to take scientific breakthroughs into production and enable communities to build the first crypto regional metropolis and create territorial and societal transformations..<br><br>
#### WEBUILD X 0XDDRL
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Most projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the "vision of the client".<br><br>
The WEBUILD X 0XDDRL model is simple and powerful solution: A decentralized network of people, that shape a vision, pool funds together and partner with a nation<br> WEBUILD offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.

## TOKEN ECONOMY FOR DECENTRALISED COORDINATION
The lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of a self-organising ecosystem for education, research and development<br><br>
#### Why a token?
A crypto economy enable participants to engage and raise their voice in a documented manner. The token is a membership subscription that is also used as a vote. 
#### Incentives system
The token allows us to create an incentives system. We want to provide the community with the means to coordinate work and allow participants to collaborate with each other to make decisions about a project. We want to enable the organic formation of self-organized permissionless working groups where everyone can participate and contribute.
We will also use tokens to create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>

Tokens are the primary source of funding for the lab. We have setup a smart contract vending machine to sell the tokens at a fixed price. 

#### $DDRL Fractions of an iconic research lab
Fractions unlock the value of the network. The $DDRL token gives people the power to vote on projects they like and surface the signal on the direction and implementation of the research. The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power.

#### $DDRL tokens are redeemable. 
Tokens can be used to interact with future services such as the acquisition of a virtual land plot  at a desirable address or  a participation certificate.

### My Notes
Metaverse is not VR
# üõ∏ A Metaverse for collective ownership of cities, and decentralized, programmable governance!

Everyone can own a fraction of the city, and help shape its future.üéñ Fractional ownership unlocks the potential of the world‚Äôs most sought after assets: Cities!<br><br>
üèÑüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö¥üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è DDRL Metaverse is specifically constructed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a new city from scratch.<br>

## The Cyber-Urban City.
DDRLM offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. <br><br>This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>
 
#### The Cyber Urban Metaverse‚Äîincreases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities
By introducing a Metaverse we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps in starting very large scale urbanization developments.<br> The Metaverse has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.<br><br> 
#### Use the Metaverse to create an economic and social reform blueprint <br>
Autonomous Cities with the use of Cyber-Urban Environments are a critical response to the failures of centrally-planned government policies.
