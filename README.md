# Fractional Cities
# ⚡️ The fractional city: A Metaverse
This is a metaverse specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire fractional ownership in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.<br>
Fractional ownership in a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the physical urban environment and the collective ownership of the public space.<br><br>
In its final form this metaverse is the interface for the governance of the physical world. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of the city and use the metaverse as a platform for cooperative governance <br><br>
 
# 💎 A new era for cyber-urban life
The new cyber-urban environment is a Metaverse where contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build!

# 🛠 Building and running cities: A blueprint for Urbanization
#### The purpose of the  Fractional city is to create a  unique transformative economic and social reform blueprint that is opening a region up to the world.
The Fractional Cyber-Urban City is a powerhouse that communities can plug into and get power to build cities. This power comes in the form of access to a decentralized cyber governance system that unlock the potential of societies for production and renewal<br> 
The Fractional City working is an open source project, enables any kind of organization, public utility corporation,  public, private, or nonprofit can be established as a collective <br> Collective ownership can encourage cooperative strategies and revenue sharing amongst participants. It is also a unique way to unlock liquidity and community building around the most popular projects. Example of projects are:  public open spaces, cooperative utility corporations, health and education systems
The Metaverse has the potential to draw citizens from around the world, and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.

# 👫 Decentralized Autonomous Joint development Working Group  👫👫👫👫
#### What is the purpose of the working group?
The fractional city offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own.<br>
The aim of this working group is to study, research and develop the field of fractional cities and the CyberUrban Metaverse and build a prototype of a virtual city.<br> 
We invite Schools of Archtecture and Urban Planning, Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens to participate and contribute.<br><br> 
We will provide a process to organize the community in the absence of a centralized leader, to describe standards, business models, and processes.<br>
### 👉This working group will study the following areas:<br>

* ✨ Digital Crypto Economic Zones. A plug and play platform<br>
* ✨ Digital Crypto Economic Zones and Private-Collective Urbanization<br>
* ✨ Native Metaverse Cooperatives. EIP<br>
* ✨ Fractional Ownership of cities. A new class of multi dimensional assets<br>
* ✨ The cyber-urban city is a network of rollups.<br>
* ✨ Turning Informal cities into powerful economies<br>
* ✨ The Metaverse for the Fractional City<br>
The list is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes<br>


### 🌐 Design a unique transformative economic and social reform blueprint that is opening [insert region] up to the world.
The group will also organize an international competition where the best proposals and prizes will emerge from community voting.
 
### Build a prototype of a virtual city<br>
The group will also build a prototype of a virtual city that will be used as a testbed for future research in the field of fractional cities and the CyberUrban Metaverse.<br>
This is an outline of our intentions. It is up to the community to continue these projects and to build on the work that has been done.

# 🚀 Self-Organised Joint Development
To participate in the "Joint development Working Group" people need to purchase a vote from the voteVening machine. A smart contract deployed on Ethereum. We create a governance structure and an incentives system to enable participants to collaborate with each other, and to make decisions on the direction and implementation of the project.<br>
We want this to be a self-organized and self-funded project that emerges from the ground. We want to allow for the organic formation of a self-organized permissionless working group where everyone can participate and contribute. Since smart contracts where initially conceived as "vending machine" we are using them to sell tickets and votes to fund teams, and projects.

Our ecosystem 
# Governance token $VOTE
The $VOTE token is a governance token that allows holders to vote on the direction and implementation of the project. Hence $LNDOG is a tool for distributing the value and power over the development of the ecosystem to the community

The $VOTE community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
📢 Innovative participation.The $VOTE gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
💰 $VOTE tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The $VOTE tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 $VOTE tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your $VOTE tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
$VOTE tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>


# 📬 Name and addresses registry

# 🏙 Metaverse Lands  
A Virtual Land registry system to serve a community-building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.


# ❓ FAQ
By operating as a decentralized platform, this metaverse, deploys participatory systems for decentralized governance to enable people to share ownership of the cyber-physical space and receive the earnings of the city.
