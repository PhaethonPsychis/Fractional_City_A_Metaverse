### 🏙 Metaverse Lands  📬 Name and addresses registry
A Virtual Land, address, and avatar name registry system is under development. Their purpose is to serve as a community-building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and services while helping people build capacity with web3 technologies and governance processes.


## 🚀 $DDRL incentives and governance Token: Building an ecosystem with the community
$DDRL is an Ethereum token that gives holders governance rights in the Decentralised Research and Design Lab.<br><br> The DDRL Token governs the development of the "Autonomous Cities in the Metaverse" project, giving holders the right to vote on the direction and implementation of the project.<br><br> The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power. <br><br>
