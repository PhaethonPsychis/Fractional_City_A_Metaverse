## CRYPTO-WEB3 URBANISM RESEARCH
### THE CYBER URBAN REGIONAL METROPOLIS: COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP
Ethereum, a blockchain computer that is fully programmable, has a unique property: It enables societies to write permanent code that has clear rules about how it will work in the future. That property has enabled the emergence of an independent field of knowledge and a space for innovation‚ÄîThe crypto-web3 domain.
The integration of the crypto-web3 domain into the field of architecture and urbanism unlocks a completely new and innovative domain of projects and research, pushing the boundaries of these disciplines in new directions.

The new crypto-urbanism domain make it possible to build novel models for cities around complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses based on collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of crypto‚Äî[architecture and]‚Äîurbanism become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.<br><br> 
We are only just beginning to explore the potential of crypto-web3 urbanism. There are already many challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this socio-technical urbanism movement successful. These challenges include developing a vision for the city of the future, translating a political and social philosophy into a system of contracts, and integrating a complex system of blockchain networks into the design and production of our architectural and urban space.<br><br>
Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The new crypto-web3 urbanism field unlocks the potential of societies to accelerate innovation. <br><br>
  
## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB
There is an opportunity for a research lab to help create a program for applied research and in Crypto-Urbanism, and implement the new models of crypto cities into real-world regional development projects.
* The first objective of the lab is to enable the design of novel city models around crypto protocols and to help integrate blockchain technologies and applications into the production of the urban environment.
* The second objective of the lab is to help bring together the domain of crypto with the domain of urbanism and establish Crypto-Urbanism as a new scientific unified field.
* The third objective is to take scientific breakthroughs into production. The lab can help bring communities and public sector together to build new crypto regional metropolisses and create territorial and societal transformations.<br>

#### WEBUILD X 0XDDRL
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Most projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the "vision of the client".<br><br>
The WEBUILD X 0XDDRL model is simple and powerful solution: A decentralized network of people, that shape a vision, pool funds together and partner with a nation<br> WEBUILD offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.

## TOKEN ECONOMY FOR DECENTRALISED COORDINATION
The lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of a self-organising ecosystem for education, research and development.<br>
#### Tokens system
$DDRL is our foundational token that allow us to create a coordination and participation system and unlock the value of the network. Holders can use the token to collaborate with each other, to make decisions about a project and to coordinate work. The purpose of the tokens system is to enable the organic formation of self-organized permissionless working groups where everyone can participate and contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>
#### A voting mechanism to surface the signal
The token enables users to participate in the decision making process and state their preferences . Holders use the token to vote on the direction and implementation of the project and build the ecosystem. $DDRL distribute value and power.The more DDRL tokens a user has locked in their voting contract, the greater the decision-making power.
#### A Lab membership 
The token is a membership subscription. Buying the token is the primary source of funding for the lab. We have set up a smart contract vending machine to sell the tokens at a fixed price.
#### Incentives and reward system
TBD
#### $DDRL tokens are redeemable. 
Tokens can be used to interact with future services such as the acquisition of a virtual land plot  at a desirable address or exchanged for a participation certificate.

## CONTRACTS
The $DDRL token is live! The official contract addressses are: 
* $DDRL TOKEN 0x...
* VENDING MACHINE 0X...

## VISION, NARRATIVE, APPLICATIONS FOR THE CRYPTO CITY

#### Collective urban development 
A system of protocols and interface, a metaverse, specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.
#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical and cyberspace. It is a new way of managing and developing the city's assets that includes public goods, utilities, and natural resources. This type of ownership allows for collective governance and management of these assets for the benefit of the city as a whole.
#### A metaverse for cyber urban avatars and programmable governance
In its final form the cyber-urban city exposes a metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environment. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.

## FAQ AND NOTES

###  What kind of technology is the metaverse? Is not VR
The Cyber Urban Metaverse‚Äî is a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain cooperatives, digital assets, virtual land systems, decentralized governance, and social platforms‚Äî <br><br>
Metaverses are networks of complex decentralized open-source code applications designed to serve communities
### üõ∏ A Metaverse for collective ownership of cities, and decentralized, programmable governance!
