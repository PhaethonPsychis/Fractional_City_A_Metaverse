## 🛠 What is the DDRL Decentralized Design Research Lab?
DDRL is a crypto-cooperative, a self-organised ecosystem of communities and teams that build this metaverse. <br>The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and  governance.<br><br> In another aspect DDRLM provides an economic and social reform blueprint that brings a region up to the world<br><br>

## What kind of Cities can we build? 
DDRLM offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. <br><br>This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment. <br><br>
Cyber-Urban Environments is a critical response to the failures of centrally-planned government policies.
