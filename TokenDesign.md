Additional features:

Decentralised Integrated storytelling:
How $DDRL will enable a global community to link different stories together and collectively shape the visions of our collective futures?
The challenge for cities will be to create stories that are compelling and interesting enough to get people to pay attention. They will also need to find ways to make sure that these stories are accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of technical expertise. $DDRL will be the first project to decentralise the process of creating a vision for the future of our cities. Each $DDRL holder serves as part of the storytelling process enabling them to vote on key aspects of a vision, including storyline, characters, and art.

Exclusive Art and Behind-the-Scenes Access:
In addition to exclusive access to future NFT drops, $DDRL token holders that vote on the vision building process will receive exclusive art and behind-the-scenes content from their favourite creators. Details TBD
