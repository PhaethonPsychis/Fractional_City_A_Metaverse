## HELPING THE WEB3 COMMUNITY SHAPE OUR WORLD
#### How can we shape our world into the one we genuinely want rather than the one that may be inevitable in the face of a myriad of challenges?

The power of the web3 community has the potential to play a key role in society, given that they are involved in the design and depiction of complex, web3 alternative realities set in the future. <br>

This potential is acknowledged by this Web3 collective, which is coming together to enable the community to participate in shaping our collective future and become a gamechanger.<br><br> 
The Collective goes beyond today's innovation to envision the potential of Web3 to its fullest extent and use it to create new worlds that we haven't seen before. <br>
This experiment engages the community in collective worldbuilding to create prototypes of desirable futures radically transformed by Web3 and map the path towards these futures.  The complexity of a futuristic web3 world is translated into a visual language that we can all understand by employing high fidelity models, futures-based narratives, science fiction literature, art, and digital assets.<br><br>
By employing systemic design and prototypes, we experiment at different levels and scales and test designs and technologies against evolution mechanics. Prototypes enable us to understand the consequences of proposed actions before they are put into practice. They are also a great tool to create a shared vision that can guide the development process and inspire people to take action.<br><br>
To facilitate this exploration and drive the design of our collective futures, this collective is developing an experimental worldbuilding model that brings Web3, integrated storytelling, and decentralized participation into the design process.
#### We will use this experimental model to prototype the future City3 and create change.<br><br>
The project explores humanity's capacity to use Web3 to re-program the intensification of the planet and build brave new cities. City3 is a container for multiple narratives to provoke unique multi-faceted insights. 
This project might lead to Science Fiction literature, TV series, film, art, digital media, comic book, or even the first city to break ground in the cyber and physical world.<br><br>
#### Integrated Storytelling: <br>
Each $BUILD token serves as part of the storytelling process allowing fans to vote on key aspects, including storyline, characters, and digital media art to help drive the ongoing narrative.
#### Exclusive Art and Behind-the-Scenes Access:<br> 
In addition to exclusive access to future drops, $BUILD holders that participate through vote  will receive exclusive art and behind-the-scenes content throughout the creation of the project.
 
#### About Web3
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems, scientific fields, design research domains, and any type of organization public, private, or cooperative.
Web3 is being touted as the future of the internet. In reality, it has so much more to offer. Introducing Web3 into real-world use cases generates novel applications with a myriad of uses that could transform our everyday lives. 
The areas with the greatest potential were broken down into five main categories:
Private Cities and regional development
Climate Change mitigation
Agriculture and food
Energy production
Human health Systems
If those potential uses become reality in the coming years, they could have a direct economic impact of up to $3 trillion per year by 2030-2040.

---------------------------------------------
The idea that web3  can inform the design of a better tomorrow is a powerful one and we need to make it a movement. 
Web3 state machines provide the foundational layer to design and prototype complex socio-economic and political systems of the future. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. We need to show people that another world is possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and [insert]maps the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome. 

This transformational power remains unused because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between communities and local governance.
