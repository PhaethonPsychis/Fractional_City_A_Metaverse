## AUTONOMOUS CYBER URBAN CITIES RESEARCH
Blockchain, web3, and internet, has unlocked an extremely rich design space for innovation in the development of private metropolises, and the fields of urbanization, and urbanism 

an extremely rich design space for innovation in the design and dev

is a group of technologies we can use to create new models for urban environments, and build new cities from scratch to create economic and social reform.<br>
Cities are the core of growth and human development. Harnessing crypto-web3 technologies we can accelerate Urbanization and create succesful cities for Growth and Poverty Alleviation.<br>
Conceptual models we are working on are:
#### Joint development and collective ownership
A cyber urban system specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making.
#### City Fractions: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in a city, is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in the physical, and cyber space. The range of the term "assets" include public utility cooperatives, public goods, the public space and natural resources, and city's revenues. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city.
#### The cyber urban metaverse
a complex system of interrelated blockchains for governance.
## DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB
There is an opportunity for a decentralized lab to coordinate the integration of crypto-web3 technologies with the production of private cities and help build the first autonomous metropolitan city by bringing together the very best research teams from the various disciplines that are relevant to the space.<br>
To drive transformation the lab addresses the most pressing issues confronting private cities.<br>


### 0XDDRL ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
The Decentralized Design Research Lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of a self-organising ecosystem for education, research and development on the domain of autonomous cities. We create the 0XDDRL crypto economy to enable communities to participate. 

### $DDRL Fractions of an iconic research lab
Fractions unlock the value of the network. The $DDRL token gives people the power to vote on projects they like and on the direction and implementation of the research.


### 0XDDRL MISSION AND PURPOSE
0XDDRL promotes innovation in the design and development of new cities from scratch. 

The purpose of DDRL 
* is to enable societies to accelerate the rate of urbanization and create economic and social reform
* The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and governance.
