## CYBER URBAN CITIES DECENTRALISED RESEARCH
Crypto, web3, and internet, the new metaverse, is a group of technologies we can use to create new models for urban environments, and build new cities from scratch to create economic and social reform.<br>

## DECENTRALIZED LAB
There is an opportunity for a decentralized lab to help investigate the integration of crypto-web3 technologies with the production of Private Cities and help build the first city with cyber urban programmable governance by bringing together the very best research teams from the various disciplines that are relevant to the space.<br>
To drive transformation the lab addresses the most pressing issues confronting private cities.<br>
The research structure

#### Models of cities and protocols on blockchain platforms that encompasses Collective ownership, and decentralized, programmable governance.
* Shaping the "Fractional city". The model-protocol enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making
* The Autonomous City. Decentralized, programmable policy, planning and urban governance. 
* The collective City. The city is a decentralized network of crypto-cooperatives owned by the citizens
We support experimental applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. 
0xDDRL aims to push the boundaries on creating new modelstechnically possible with blockchain applications.

#### Develop the domain of the Cyber Urban Metaverse
Cyber Urban Metaverse is the virtual space to enable citizens interact with the built environment and the local governance 
This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment.

#### Design a metaverse- blockchain, web3, governance, treasury, policy framework- that:
* increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities 
* create an economic and social reform that brings the entire region up to the world standard
* A new era for cyber-urban life

### 0XDDRL DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB:ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Decentralized Design Research Lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of self-organising education, research and development ecosystem. We create the 0XDDRL crypto economy to enable communities to participate



### 0XDDRL MISSION AND PURPOSE
0XDDRL promotes innovation in the design and development of new cities from scratch. 0XDDRL promotes the Cyber Urban Metaverse, a model for collective ownership of cities, with decentralized, programmable governance!

//The purpose of DDRL 

_ The purpose of 0XDDRL is:
    to create the metaverse for the Cyber Urban City
    to develop a blueprint for the Cyber Urban City
        the purpose of the C.U. City is to enable societies to accelerate the rate of urbanization and create economic and social reform
   
    to investigate the application of blockchain technologies in the domain of Private Cities 


 
The purpose-area of focus
of a blueprint to increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities that bring economic and social reform in entire regions
promotes innovation in the field of design and development of new cities 

is a new model for Decentralized Design Research 

_ DDRLA ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
0XDDRL is an experiment in self-organization of decentralized research and development ecosystems.  

 The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and governance.

### 0XDDRL CRYPTO ECONOMY
_ 0XDDRL is building its own Token based economy to self funded 
$DDRL is building an economy

promotes a new model for Cyber-Urban Cities to solve collective ownership of cities and decentralized programmable governance
