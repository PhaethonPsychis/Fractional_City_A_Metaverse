THE OPPORTUNITY
Crypto, web3, and internet, the metaverse, is a group of technologies we can use to create new models for urban developments, and build new cities from scratch to create economic and social reform.<br>
There is an opportunity for a decentralized research and development ecosystem to help investigate the integration of metaverse technologies in the production, collective ownership, and programmable governance of entirely new cities and help shape a blueprint for the cyber urban city by bringing together the very best research teams from the various disciplines that are relevant to the space.


0XDDRL promotes innovation in the design and development of new cities from scratch. 0XDDRL promotes the Cyber Urban Metaverse, a model for collective ownership of cities, with decentralized, programmable governance!

//The purpose of DDRL 

_ The purpose of 0XDDRL is:
    to create the metaverse for the Cyber Urban City
    to develop a blueprint for the Cyber Urban City
        the purpose of the C.U. City is to enable societies to accelerate the rate of urbanization and create economic and social reform
   
    to investigate the application of blockchain technologies in the domain of Private Cities 


 
The purpose-area of focus
of a blueprint to increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities that bring economic and social reform in entire regions
promotes innovation in the field of design and development of new cities 

is a new model for Decentralized Design Research 

_ DDRLA ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
0XDDRL is an experiment in self-organization of decentralized research and development ecosystems.  

how to organize a research and development ecosystem as a decentralized collective 
Research and Design  is a crypto-cooperative, a self-organised ecosystem of communities and teams that are focused on building this metaverse. The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and governance.
