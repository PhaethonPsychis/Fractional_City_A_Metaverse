## AUTONOMOUS CYBER URBAN CITIES RESEARCH
Crypto, web3, and internet, the new metaverse, is a group of technologies we can use to create new models for urban environments, and build new cities from scratch to create economic and social reform.<br>
Cities are the core of growth and human development. Harnessing crypto-web3 technologies we can create a cyber-urban infrastructure to accelerate Urbanization and create succesful cities for Growth and Poverty Alleviation.

## DECENTRALIZED DESIGN RESEARCH LAB
There is an opportunity for a decentralized lab to help investigate the integration of crypto-web3 technologies with the production of private cities and help build the first city with cyber urban programmable governance by bringing together the very best research teams from the various disciplines that are relevant to the space.<br>
To drive transformation the lab addresses the most pressing issues confronting private cities.<br>
The research structure
#### Investigate the application of blockchain networks on the level of a metropolitan city 
0XDDRL city project aim to push the boundaries of what is technically possible with blockchain applications and create a functioning prototype. We support experimental open source protocols.<br>
#### Create Models-protocols of cities on blockchain platforms
This group is focused on collective ownership, and decentralized, programmable governance. Think of models as a composable system that create the city.
* The "Fractional city". The model-protocol enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making
* The Autonomous City. Decentralized, programmable policy, planning and urban governance. 
* The collective City. The city is a decentralized network of crypto-cooperatives owned by the citizens
We support experimental applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. 
0xDDRL aims to push the boundaries on creating new modelstechnically possible with blockchain applications.

#### Develop the domain of the Cyber Urban City
Cyber Urban Metaverse is the virtual space to enable citizens interact with the built environment and the local governance 
This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment.

#### Design a Cyber-Urban system that increases our capacity to fund and develop new cities that are Autonomous and can create an economic and social reform that brings an entire region up to the world standard.<br>
* Create a strategic framework for policy, planning and urban governance
* Create a metaverse to enableâ€” A new era for cyber-urban life
* Assembly a technology stack

#### Design an Autonomous Metropolitan Region
TBD. Apply the Cyber Urban System in physical geographical locations. International Event with open participation and Prizes

### 0XDDRL ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
The Decentralized Design Research Lab is an experiment aiming to push the boundaries in the creation of a self-organising ecosystem for education, research and development on the domain of autonomous cities. We create the 0XDDRL crypto economy to enable communities to participate. 

### $DDRL Fractions of an iconic research lab
Fractions unlock the value of the network. The $DDRL token gives people the power to vote on projects they like and on the direction and implementation of the research.


### 0XDDRL MISSION AND PURPOSE
0XDDRL promotes innovation in the design and development of new cities from scratch. 

The purpose of DDRL 
* is to enable societies to accelerate the rate of urbanization and create economic and social reform
* The purpose of the DDRL Metaverse is to solve the problems associated with the development of Private Cities: investors funding, citizens participation in value created and governance.
