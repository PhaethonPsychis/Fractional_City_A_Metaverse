The research structure
#### Investigate the application of blockchain networks on the level of a metropolitan city 
0XDDRL city project aim to push the boundaries of what is technically possible with blockchain applications and create a functioning prototype. We support experimental open source protocols.<br>
#### Create Models-protocols of cities on blockchain platforms
This group is focused on collective ownership, and decentralized, programmable governance. Think of models as a composable system that create the city.
* The "Fractional city". The model-protocol enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire a fraction in city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making
* The Autonomous City. Decentralized, programmable policy, planning and urban governance. 
* The collective City. The city is a decentralized network of crypto-cooperatives owned by the citizens
We support experimental applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. 
0xDDRL aims to push the boundaries on creating new modelstechnically possible with blockchain applications.

#### Develop the domain of the Cyber Urban City
Cyber Urban Metaverse is the virtual space to enable citizens interact with the built environment and the local governance 
This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world with the physical urban environment.

#### Design a Cyber-Urban system that increases our capacity to fund and develop new cities that are Autonomous and can create an economic and social reform that brings an entire region up to the world standard.<br>
* Create a strategic framework for policy, planning and urban governance
* Create a metaverse to enableâ€” A new era for cyber-urban life
* Assembly a technology stack

#### Design an Autonomous Metropolitan Region
TBD. Apply the Cyber Urban System in physical geographical locations. International Event with open participation and Prizes
